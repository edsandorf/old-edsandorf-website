It is well-known that operating within the boundaries of a national park provides commercial actors with the opportunity to charge a price premium, though this has to a lesser degree been demonstrated for marine protected areas. 

We estimate national tourists' willingness-to-pay a price premium for boat trips
in the Nha Trang Bay Marine Protected Are, Vietnam, using a discrete choice experiment. Our results
show that tourists are willing to pay an average price premium of 18 USD per trip for a large
improvement in environmental quality, and that avoiding the loss of jobs for local fishermen is of minor
importance. Furthermore, the economic benefits generated from management scenarios that combine
biodiversity restoration and environmental quality improvement within the reserve sufficient to cover
additional costs of such improvements.
