I am a Marie Sklodowska-Curie Research Fellow with the Economics Division at the Stirling Managment School. I hold a PhD in Environmental Economics from UiT - The Arctic University of Norway. My research interests lie in the areas of choice modeling and environmental economics. I specialize in the application of advanced discrete choice models in the context of environmental valuation.
