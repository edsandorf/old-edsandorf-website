With the new and revamped website, I have decided to start a blog. I am not a very experienced blogger and was introduced to the concept of having one through the [INSPiRE project](https://inspire-project.info). To me, the blog will be a pathway to impact. A place where I can provide a more personal opinion on the research that I, and my colleagues, do. Much of the work that I do focuses on the use of advanded choice models to understand better how people make decisions in markets (both real and hypothetical). This blog will also be an opportunity to write posts on how I solved particularly challenging or interesting problems in R. In that regard, it will be a place for me to go when I encounter a similar problem in the future, and hopefully a place where you can learn from my efforts.

The first blog post will be a guest post I wrote for the INSPiRE project about what economists mean when they talk about utility and preferences.
