In the period 2000 – 2015, Vietnam saw a formidable growth in shrimp aquaculture and in 2016 it was one of the largest producers of shrimp in the world exporting to 90 different markets and generating more than 2.9 billion US dollars in export revenue. However, the rapid growth in shrimp aquaculture, and excessive use of antibiotics and chemicals in production has had a detrimental effect on product quality and the immediate coastal environment. A potential solution is to move from conventional shrimp farming practices to high-tech shrimp farming practices. However, uncertainty about future prices and lack of access to financing has deterred many small scale producers from investing in high-tech production equipment. A potential solution is to offer a credit subsidy that includes a government guarantee and a subsidized interest rate to ease access to capital. Using two discrete choice experiments, this project seeks to estimate the size of a possible subsidy through a credit subsidy scheme and estimate to what degree the general population are willing to pay to help cover the cost. The results of the project will provide policy guidance on how to transition from conventional to high-tech shrimp farming by exploring both the supply and demand side of the policy.
