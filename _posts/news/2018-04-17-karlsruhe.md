I taught the course Discrete Choice Analysis with R for researchers at the Europ채isches Institut f체r Energieforschnung (EIfER) EDF-KIT from the 8th - 12th of October 2018. The three day course covered introduction to stated preference experimental design and analysis of discrete choice data. Each day started with 3 hours of lectures in the morning followed by 3 hours of hands-on work after lunch.
