I presented the working paper "Assessing the impact of 'professional' respondents using an integrated choice and latent variable model" at the [6th World Congress for Environmental and Resource Economists](http://www.eaere-conferences.org/index.php?y=2018) in Gothenburg. The paper addresses a concern among stated preference practioners relying on online panels to gather data, that some panel members may have substantial experience with answering surveys and that they are "in it for the money". While not inherently bad or irrational, if these respondents are motivated only by the monetary compensation, and engage in simplifying survey behavior to obtain the compensation with the least amount of effort, then this may lead to poorer data quality.
