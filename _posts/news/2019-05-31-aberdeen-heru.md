I was invited to give a seminar in the Health Economics Research Group (HERU) seminar series in Aberdeen on the 31st of May 2019. The title of the talk was: "The search for something better - A consideration set model". The role that information search plays in economic decision making has long been recognized. The seminar focused on how the search for new information about alternatives plays an important part in how consideration sets are formed, i.e. that they are the result of a sequential process (in a temporal sense) of evaluating alternatives. This seminar is the first presenting some of the results from the [INSPiRE project](https://inspire-project.info).
