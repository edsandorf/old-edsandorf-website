Today I started my new position as a Marie Sklodowska-Curie Research Fellow with the University of Stirling. The position is for 2 years and is part of the [INSPiRE Project](https://inspire-project.info). 

The project is funded by the Eurpoean Research Council and gotten in collaboration with Professor Danny Campbell. I have worked extensively with Professor Campbell in the past, and I am exited to continue that work now in Stirling.
