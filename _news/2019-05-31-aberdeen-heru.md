I was invited to give a talk in the Health Economics Research Group (HERU) seminar series in Aberdeen on the 31st of May 2019. The title of the talk was: "The search for something better - A consideration set model".

The talk was centered around the role that the search for information and new alternatives play in the formation of consideration sets and subsequent choice. This was the first talk presenting some of the results from the [INSPiRE project](https://inspire-project.info).
