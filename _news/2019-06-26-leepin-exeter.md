I gave a poster presentation titled: "The effect of device experience and time of day on stated preferences" at the LEEPin2019 Conference in Exter 24th - 26th of June 2019 at the University of Exeter. 

The working paper, on which the poster is based, is concerned with the response quality of people answering stated preference surveys on their mobile phones or on a desktop computer. We use the number of surveys a given respondent has answered on each device as a proxy for device experience in the survey context. Prelimenary results suggests that there is an experience effect, i.e. more experience is associated with a relatively more deterministic choice process (as seen from the econometrician's point of view), but that the effect is non-linear and starts to flatten and decrease around 100 surveys answered on a given device.
